## How to run the game
Simply open the .py file with python, either by right-clicking it or navigating to its directory in the command line.  
Or, if you prefer, open it with the IDE of your choice and run from there.

## How to play
Each number in a cell represents how many mines surround that cell, 'F' represents a flag, 'M' represents a mine, and 'X' represents a misplaced flag.

In the top left corner is how many mines remain, and in the top right corner is the timer. The top centre button resets the game.

Click on a cell to start the game. Right-click or press [space] on a closed cell to flag it, or on an open cell to open all surrounding cells.
